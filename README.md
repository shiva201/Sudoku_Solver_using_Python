The Sudoku Solver with Pygame is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that leverages the Pygame library to implement an interactive and visually appealing Sudoku puzzle-solving experience. The application allows users to input an incomplete Sudoku puzzle and then utilizes a backtracking algorithm to solve it step by step. The Pygame library facilitates the creation of a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the puzzle, view the solving process, and understand the solution in a visually intuitive manner.

GUI Interface: The Pygame library enables the creation of a graphical user interface that provides a Sudoku grid layout where users can input the initial values of the puzzle and visualize the solving process.

Input and Validation: Users can input the incomplete Sudoku puzzle by clicking on the cells and entering numbers. The application should handle input validation to ensure that only valid values are entered (i.e., integers between 1 and 9) and that the puzzle satisfies the Sudoku rules before attempting to solve it.

Backtracking Algorithm: The solver part of the application employs a backtracking algorithm to find the solution to the incomplete Sudoku puzzle. Backtracking is a systematic method that explores possible solutions and backtracks when an invalid move is made, allowing the application to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles of varying complexities.

Visual Feedback: During the solving process, the application can display visual feedback to users, such as highlighting cells that are currently being evaluated by the algorithm or animating the process of backtracking to illustrate the exploration of different possibilities.

Solution Display: Once the puzzle is solved, the application should display the complete and correct solution to the user. This provides a satisfying experience for users who want to check their solutions or use the solver as a learning tool.

Reset and Clear: The GUI should include options to reset the puzzle to its initial state and clear individual cells if users wish to start over or modify their input.
